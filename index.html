    <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <h3>Web and Mobile development Internship</h3><span class="date">October 2024 - February 2025</span>
    <h3>XpertBot</h3> 
    <p>During my internship at XpertBot, I gained hands-on experience in Laravel (PHP) and Flutter (Dart) while contributing to real-world projects. I assisted in developing web applications using MVC architecture, Eloquent ORM, and database migrations, ensuring efficient data management. On the mobile side, I built responsive UIs with Flutter widgets (Container, Row, Column) and integrated RESTful APIs using Postman for testing. I also collaborated with the team using Git for version control, learning best practices in branching, merging, and conflict resolution. This internship strengthened my skills in full-stack development and cross-platform app deployment, providing a solid foundation for professional growth.</p>
    <h3>Foundation of Computer Science Bootcamp </h3> <span class="date">February 2025 - April 2025</span>
    <h3> SE Factory</h3> 
    <p>During this intensive bootcamp, I built a strong foundation in programming and web development. I mastered Python fundamentals, including functions, recursion, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, while implementing various data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues. For web development, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic front-end interfaces, and learned back-end development using PHP with SQL database integration. The program emphasized practical coding skills, problem-solving techniques, and industry best practices, preparing me for real-world development challenges. Through collaborative exercises and individual coding tasks, I developed the ability to write clean, efficient code while understanding the full web development lifecycle from front-end to back-end.</p>
